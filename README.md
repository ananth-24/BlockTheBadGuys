# BlockTheBadGuys
Motto: Moving towards an abuse-free online world

Reason: Over the years internet trolls and abuses have made lot of mishaps which have even resulted in suicides and harassments.This tempted us to find a solution for this problem.

Link to the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

Approach:

We used 2 approaches - one using LSTM and the other using 6 logistic regressions combined.

The LSTM achieved around 97.7% accuracy for both training set and validation set.

We have also almost built a web app using django to automatically disallow toxic and abusive comments.
